# ECE 239AS Computational Imaging Curated Project Submission

## Authors:

* Bryan Bednarski
* Dennis Wang
* Joshua Hannan
* Zach Harris

## How to run the project:

This project was run using Google Colaboratory. Training, validation, and test data are placed in a Drive folder.
In order to run the project, perform the following steps:

1. Open `ECE239AS_project-denoise` or `ECE239AS_project-deblur` in Google Colab
2. Add the following folder to your Google Drive: [239ASCompImagingData](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12SdmyJJR6txMwZM2vBoVmtlmAySfAPxA?usp=sharing)
3. Run the project, giving google drive access when prompted

1. `runs/`: saved runs of the Colab files
2. `kernels/`: the blur kernels used by `ECE239AS_project-deblur`
3. `images_noisy/`: noisy images generated by `make_noise.py`
4. `images_blurry_motion/`: motion-blurry images generated by `make_blur.m`
4. `images_blurry_disk/`: disk-blurry images generated by `make_blur.m`
5. `images/`: the original BSDS500 image dataset

## Contents of repository:

### Directories:

1. `saved_runs/`: results from running `ECE239AS_project-denoise` and `ECE239AS_project-deblur` used in our report

### Files

1. `ECE239AS_project-denoise.ipynb`: trains the Denoise ODP network
2. `ECE239AS_project-deblur.ipynb`: trains the Deblur ODP network for motion and disk blur (blur_name specified in file)
3. `Unrolled Optimization with Deep Priors.pdf`: Original work we are reproducing
4. `image_generator.py`: python file containing the Keras Image Generator we use in `ECE239AS_project-denoise` and `ECE239AS_project-deblur`
5. `make_blur.m`: matlab file that saves the blur kernels as .mat files, and generates blurry images by using these kernels
6. `make_noise.py`: python file that generates noisy images
